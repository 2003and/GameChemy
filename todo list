TODO:
    make testing !!!
    replace menu with walkable lab !!!
    add plot:
       master leaves his apprentice(protagonist)
       master goes to some person
       some person shall give the protagonist access to magic lens, after the protagonist masters the given knowledge of alchemy
       maybe, at some point will be a boss fight with the master of the protagonist
       if there will be, then the unknown person will help the player to easily win a fight by upgrading the obtained lens with some potion
       protagonist starts to build theories about alchemy, while master left to another person
       protagonist makes a theory about making potions with a special ritual, but accidentally locked his lab with the code lock, code for which he forgot
       protagonist shall now look through the magic lens on the stars to find out the code for his lab
       after that, alchemical notes shall have a new note in them about those rituals and how they are passed
       after that, the game's plot shall be finished... for now...
    add visor providing extra information (perhaps, think of more information about everything)

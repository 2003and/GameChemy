Hello there, dear player. I made those notes for you tolearn alchemy. Huh? What's fourth wall? Anyway, I      know,that you are, probably, a newbie in this game, and this... uhh... "Guide", I guess, shall move you       through the basics of this game. NOTE: not all aspects  of the game shall be covered in this guide. Well,      enough  of this - the guide starts on the next page... Oh, and, by the way, - you can navigate between scenes with buttons in the drop down menu un the left upper   corner.

Now, what do you think alchemy is about? Correct!      Brewing!.. Well, at least I hope, that you knew it...  Anyway, to brew a potion, you have to put two differentdusts in the cauldron (water is put automatically,     because I'm an engineer, and the developer is lazy),   and then mix them with the V button. If you want to    clear the contents of the cauldron - press the X buttonThis way you can create not more than 6 basic potions. Swapping dusts will not make a difference to the recipeDo you know, what are people that expect from the same thing different results are called?

If you didn't learn brewing first, then  you won't be  able to proceed to this chapter, because it's about    inverting potions! Not all potions' nature is strong   enough to withstand the process, so they just transforminto an essence I called "arelh essence", because I'm  a creative person... Seriously, no reasons to call it  so at all... When the potion is inverted, it will have the opposite effect it had before inverting. If you put the wrong potion, you can remove it by pressing the X button! (just as in the brewing section, but without   the V button...)

Do you remember the "arelh essence" from the previous  chapter? Great! This essence has a lot of power in it. This power can be released into potions, so they will  boost their effect. Not all potions can be infused     either. Just as in inverting, their nature isn't       strong enough. And, again, press the red X to remove   the potion...                                                                                                 P.S.:Don't ask why the potions don't fall off this     construction. It's magic of developer's laziness.

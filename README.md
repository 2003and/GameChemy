### An unusual alchemy game
Hello! I'm 2003and! And I want to become a game developer(or, at least a normal developer). This game is one of my
cherry on top of all of my other games/programs/utilities. I was making this game almost for a month (26 days). And it
will be used in my school project, so it's very important for me.

Btw, let's find out some confusing moments in the game:
* when you choose a potion in a menu, you have to tap SPACE in order to select it
* potions are wasted, so you have to cook them from time to time
* any other questions can be explained in Alchemical Notes (the "guide" section of the game)

If you have suggestions, tell me, and I might implement them in the game!

Current (unfinished) suggestions:
* None! Be the first do suggest one!

Q&A:
* None! Be the first to ask one!
